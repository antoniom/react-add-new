# react-add-new

### âœ¨ CLI tool to create new React components

A utility for quickly adding new React components. Not configurable for the moment, utilizes predefined templates and styles are generated assuming you are using
Material UI and styled components.

## Usage

You can install the package globally using the following command:

```
npm i -g react-add-new
```

After successful installation, you can utilize the package using the following command:

```
react-add-new
```

Alternatively, you can utilize it using the command:

```
npx react-add-new
```

This command will print all the available CLI options. A new component can be created using either interactive mode or command arguments.

#### Interactive mode

You can enter interactive mode using the following command:

```
react-add-new component -i
```

Terminal prompts will guide you through the component generation process. Component generation path is selected using fuzzy search and you can set the desired depth for limiting the depth of sub-folders to scan:

```
react-add-new component -i --depthLimit 10
```

Please note that when `-i` command line argument is provided, non-interactive mode arguments are ignored ðŸ™ƒ.

#### Non-interactive mode

You can create a component directly in non-interactive mode using the following command:

```
react-add-new component -n TestComponent -p components
```

You can also provide the oprional arguments `--noStyles` and `--noTypes`, in order to exclude styles & types from generation.
